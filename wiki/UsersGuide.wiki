=Usage=

==Finding Karaoke Files==
Using the left top pane, browse to the directory containing karaoke files and press 'Scan'.  This will recursively search for files from the chosen location.  Karaoke files will showup in the right hand media pane.

Scanning multiple directories will add to the songs found in the media pane.  Scanning the same directory more than once will not add duplicates in the media pane.

The found songs are automatically saved.

==Starting Over==

Emptyorchestra saves information under your user home directory in a directory called .emptyorch.  You can start the karaoke database over by removing the .musicdata file under this directory.


==Searching Songs==

Underneath the media pane in the right side of the screen, a user may type in a search term.  Pressing enter will filter the media pane.  Pressing the 'x' on the search will un-filter the media pane.

== Playing Songs ==

You can play a highlighted song by clicking the button labeled 'Play Selected' or by pressing enter.

==Using the Playlist==

Emptyorchestra allows you to select a series of songs into a playlist.  You can then play the entire playlist, re-arrange the playlist or remove items from the playlist.

After highlighting songs in the media pane, pressing 'Add to Playlist' will copy the chosen songs into the playlist in the lower right section of the screen.

The user may adjust the order of the playlist by clicking on the up or down arrow buttons above the playlist.  Clicking the 'x' button on the playlist will remove the highlighted song from the playlist.

==Syncing The Music==

No one wants to have the lyrics come up at the wrong time during their song!  

Emptyorchestra allows you to sync the lyrics to the music while the song is playing.  

Tap the right arrow to have the lyrics come up sooner, tap the left arrow to have the lyrics come up later.

==Saving The Settings==

Emptyorchestra will automatically preserve settings from the interface.  This would include:

* Karaoke window size and position
* Fullscreen display
* Lyric offset
